# Example `repo-parser` Generated Site

This is an example of the type of site you might be able to generate with [repo-parser].

It is deliberately kept minimal: the core capability demonstrated is the ability
to scale to dozens or hundreds of libraries, services, or any other core domain
object you (or your organization!) might be able to come up with, while keeping
documentation and related resources _inside_ their respective part of the repository.

```{toctree}

services/index
languages/index
libraries/index
```
